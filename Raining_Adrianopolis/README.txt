Hydrology is the science that encompasses the occurrence, distribution, movement and properties of the waters of the earth and their relationship with the environment within each phase of the hydrologic cycle. (https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/what-hydrology)

This is a field of study that's very relevant for engineers and scientists for making predictions (or try) and get good models for estimate the amount of raining and the impact that it has in certain applications, like in civil engineering when you are dealing with barrages, and has to build a resistent wall to suport the water of an reservatory, or when you are worring about the raining cicle and wanna to predict the amount estimate for certain year so this wouldn't destroy your farm.

This field of study is very important and has many impacts, it's very dificult to predict the weater because it's constantly changing for region to region.

It's known that the weater is a chaotic model, that means a small change of the inputs can make enourmous changes on the output, in other words, a chaotic model isn't easy to predict and has many variables to attent. This when data science comes, we can try to fit a model over a big amount of data colected year after year and predict the amount of rain for certain years. (Recommended study: chaos theory)
